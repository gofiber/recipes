# A Hexagonal Software Architecture in Golang and MongoDB
This presents a simple product catalogue microservice to demonstrate the principles of a hexagonal software architecture. The microservice exposes a RESTful API that allows consuming applications to perform CRUD operations on a product catalogue. The microservice is developed in Golang, and the product catalogue data is persisted in a MongoDB repository.
